# Strategies for Handling Missing Values

A number of courses in the *Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization* on Coursera force students to deal with messy data, including missing values in the data. This leads them to ask questions about different ways for managing missing values, given that this topic is not covered in any level of detail in the specialization.

To provide more background on this topic, I've compiled the following list of resources on missing values. Since articles posted on the internet sometimes disappear over time for various reasons, I've referenced local copies of the publicly available articles.

    <td>Author(s): Peter Schmitt, Jonas Mandel, and Mickael Guedj <br><br>Article compares six different imputation methods against four real data sets of varying sizes. Results are based on four evaluation criteria, including root mean squared error, unsupervised classification error, supervised classification error, and execution time.
