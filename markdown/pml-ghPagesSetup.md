# Overview
Github Pages is a tool to create a website from a github repository. When the Data Science Specialization was built back in 2014, students in the *Practical Machine Learning* course frequently expressed frustration at the work required to correctly configure Github Pages.

Over the years Github has made it much easier to publish content via Github pages. The biggest improvement is that one can publish content directly from the *main* branch, rather than having to create a *gh-pages* branch from which a repository's content is published. 

## Process as of April 2022

The current process is a very simple 5 steps that publishes from the main branch of a repository:

1. Create a repository
2. Clone the repository to a local computer
3. Create an index.html file on the local computer
4. Commit and push the html file to the remote repository
5. Navigate to https://username.github.io/username/reponame to see the website

Github has published a short walkthrough of the process to create a personal website based on a github repository that has the same name as one's github userid [here](https://pages.github.com).
