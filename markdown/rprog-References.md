## References for R Programming

Periodically students in the Johns Hopkins University *R Programming* course on Coursera ask for a list of R references. Here is a list of references that I use.

<table>
<tr><th>Reference</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://bit.ly/2yhQkdq"> R Programming for Data Science </a></td><td>Start here! <em>R Programming for Data Science</em> is written by Roger Peng specifically to be read along with the JHU <em>R Programming</em> course. Since it's available on leanpub.com, you can decide how much to pay for it, including "free." </td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="https://bit.ly/2x6aVTt"> R Documentation</a></td><td>The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) is the authoritiative source for all things related to R. The R Documentation page on CRAN provides an index to a variety of manuals and other documentation related to R. </td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://bit.ly/2CcN9Ct"> R for Data Science</a></td><td>Written by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, <em>R for Data Science </em> explains how to load data into R, transform it for data analysis, model it, and generate graphics / reports using packages from what is called the <strong>tidyverse</strong>, which is covered in <em>Getting and Cleaning Data</em>. Best of all, the entire book can be accessed online for free.<br><br>Throughout the book Grolemund and Wickham introduce key tools in the <a href="http://bit.ly/2ihagWZ">tidyverse </a>, a collection of R packages designed to create, manage, and analyze what is called <em>tidy data</em>, a concept that originated with Wickham's 2014 paper in the <a href="http://bit.ly/2guNg2K">Journal of Statistical Software</a>.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="https://bit.ly/2wxptv7"> Hands On Programming with R</a></td><td>Written by Garrett Grolemund, coauthor of <em>R for Data Science</em>, <em>Hands On Programming with R</em> is a free online version of a book that provides an in depth introduction to programming R functions and objects through a series of projects.  
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://bit.ly/2x6Rf0y"> Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown</a></td><td>Developed by Chester Ismay, <em>Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown</em> is a free online reference designed to help people develop reproducible research. It focuses on the server version of RStudio, but many of the concepts are applicable to the desktop version. 
</td></tr>  

<tr><td><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Programming-Statistical-Software-Design/dp/1593273843/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1464579557&sr=8-1&keywords=the+art+of+R+programming"> The Art of R Programming </a></td><td>Written by Norman Matloff, <em>The Art of R Programming</em> is focused on R as a programming language, even though Matloff is a statistician. In the book you'll find plenty of examples that will help you solve R coding problems. It's available on Amazon.com in e-book format for $19.99 USD. </td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-OReilly-Cookbooks-Paul-Teetor-ebook/dp/B004VB3UYW?ie=UTF8&keywords=r%20cookbook%20o%27reilly%20cookbooks&qid=1464579855&ref_=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2&s=books&sr=1-1"> R Cookbook </a></td><td>Written by Paul Teetor <em>R Cookbook</em> is designed like a cookbook, or like Christopher Alexander's <em>A Pattern Language</em> if you're familiar with the software patterns movement from the late 1990s. It is structured as a series of <em>problem / solution / discussion</em> topics to help the reader solve very specific problems with R. It's available on Amazon.com in e-book format for $20.49 USD. </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/caching-variables.html"> Efficient R Programming</a></td><td>Written by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace, <em>Efficient R Programming</em> guides the reader through the process to set up an R environment, and then explains how to write efficient R code, that is, code which consumes fewer resources and runs faster than code written by a typical beginning R porgrammer. The URL listed here is for the online version of the book, available free on github.io. </td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action-second-edition"> R in Action, Second Edition </a></td><td>Written by Robert Kabacoff, <em>R in Action Second Edition</em> is an excellent guide to R from both a programming as well as a statistical perspective. When purchased from the manning.com website, one can obtain both paper and electronic copies of the book. On manning.com, it's available for $59.99 in the e-book + paper format. I prefer this format because I always have a copy with me, and can read the dead tree version when I don't want to read from an e-book.<br><br> Kabacoff also maintains a website that includes content related to the book, it's called <a href="https://bit.ly/2X9AcXB">Quick R</a>. </td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://bit.ly/2wlKuml"> Advanced R </a></td><td>Don't let the title intimidate you from getting this book. Written by Hadley Wickham, <em>Advanced R</em> contains a lot of valuable content for any R developer, including beginners. <em>Advanced R</em> is available in e-book format on Amazon.com for $47.36 USD.<br><br> Wickham also maintains a website that includes content related to the book, it's called <a href="http://bit.ly/2wlKuml">Advanced R</a>, and is maintained as a companion to the book.
<br><br>As of April 2020, <a href="https://bit.ly/advR2ndEd"> Advanced R Second Edition </a> is now avaliable online. It represents a significant revision of the concepts presented in the first edition, and is well worth the read. </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="http://bit.ly/2vwTj0Z"> R Tutor Website </a></td><td>This website provides three sets of tutorials, basic R, elementary statistics with R, and graphics processor unit computing with R. The site is maintained by Chi Yau, who has a Ph.D. in Mathematics. </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="http://bit.ly/2wWjXht"> R Inferno </a></td><td>A humorous look at the various problems people have when learning R, based on Dante's <em>Inferno</em>. Written by <a href="http://www.burns-stat.com/about-burns-statistics/"> Patrick Burns, Ph.D.</a>, a statistics consultant and one of the lead developers of S-PLUS early in its development. </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="http://bit.ly/2cmqAPy"> Lexical Scoping and Statistical Computing </a></td><td>Article by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka that explains the use of lexical scoping within statistical computing, the topic of programming assignment 2. </td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Testing-Code-Chapman-Hall-CRC-ebook/dp/B01N6Y5GAJ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1489888218&sr=1-1&keywords=testing+r+code"> Testing R Code</a></td><td>Written by Richard Cotton, this book helps people write R code that is testable, so one can have confidence that it works when used to conduct analyses, or is included in a production software application.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://bit.ly/3dXQ9G4">Statistical Inference via Data Science: a modern dive into R and the tidyverse</a> </td><td>Written by Chester Ismay and Albert Kim, this book provides an introduction to statistical inference using RStudio and R packages that are current as of 2019, focusing on the tidyverse group of R packages. The first few chapters, in addition to introducing R and RStudio, cover topics that are relevant to the <em>Getting & Cleaning Data</em> course in the JHU data science specialization. Chapters 5 through 10 are relevant for the regression and machine learning courses in the JHU specialization. </td></tr>
