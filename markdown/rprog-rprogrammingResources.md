# Resources for *R Programming*

Here is a list of resources that will be helpful as you progress through the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization's *R Programming* course. One of the challenges presented by this course is that it depends on the hacker mentality that the professors introduced in the *Data Scientist's Toolbox* -- you have to spend some time figuring out the resources beyond the lectures and slides to help solve the problems.

# R Tutorials

In 2017, [Data Science Central](https://bit.ly/2KYoY0N) published a list of [100 Free Tutorials for R](https://bit.ly/2Wsz3s6). The list is divided into two categories: one focused on Learning R, and another where the focus is on data science topics but including R tutorials. 

## Coursera R Programming

Beyond resources that aren't directly related to the JHU Data Science Specialization, past students have developed a large amount of content to guide others through the course, starting with the [R Programming](http://datasciencespecialization.github.io/rprog/) page on the [Data Science Specialization](http://datasciencespecialization.github.io/) github site.

## Assignment 1 Topics

For assignment 1, [Derek Franks' Tutorial for those struggling with Programming Assignment 1](https://github.com/derekfranks/practice_assignment) is very helpful, along with my articles:
* [Strategy for the Programming Assignments](http://bit.ly/2ddFh9A), 
* [Forms of the Extract Operator](http://bit.ly/2bzLYTL),  
* [Breaking Down Pollutantmean](http://bit.ly/2cHyiCl), 
* [Assignment 1: Common Mistakes - Weighted vs. Unweighted Means](http://bit.ly/2cA0fSh), 
* [Assignment 1: Common Mistakes - complete("specdata",332:1) fails](http://bit.ly/2uSLhui), and 
* [Assignment 1: A More Elegant Solution](http://bit.ly/2kwBBlK) 


## Assignment 2 Topics

### The Assignment

For assignment 2, DanieleP's [Tutorial for those Struggling with Programming Assignment 2](https://github.com/DanieleP/PA2-clarifying_instructions) is helpful, along with my articles [makeCacheMatrix as an Object](http://bit.ly/2byUe4e), and [R Objects, S Objects, and Lexical Scoping](http://bit.ly/2dtOSXi), which references an extended version of the Lexical Scoping lecture from a 2003 JHU Biostatistics class. Given all of the challenges people have in understanding this assignment, I have also posted a complete walkthrough of the <code>makeVector()</code> function in the article [Demystifying makeVector()](http://bit.ly/2bTXXfq).

### Git and Github

Many students struggle with use of Github for this assignment. Git and Github are covered in *The Data Scientist's Toolbox*, and there is a lot of content explaining how to use Git and Github on the Data Science Specializtion Community Site's [Data Scientist's Toolbox](http://bit.ly/2c9FGMa) page. 

## Assignment 3 Topics

Finally, for assignment 3, take a look at DanieleP's [Tutorial for those Struggling with Programming Assignment 3](https://github.com/DanieleP/PA3-tutorial), along with my articles [Functions to Sort Data Frames](http://bit.ly/2dxItzw), and [Forms of the Extract Operator](http://bit.ly/2bzLYTL).

A list of other R resources is available at [References for R Programming](http://bit.ly/2b8AxhF). If you have a background in SAS, the transition to R can be challenging. I've posted a number of articles on this topic, starting with [R Onboarding for SAS Users](http://bit.ly/2dr7yum). Finally, if you're stuck, make sure you use the Discussion Forums to get help. A significant part of the learning process in online courses occurs on the Discussion Forums. The more you invest in them, the more you'll learn.

# Relevant posts on Stackoverflow

One of the best ways to learn about R is to read code written by other people. Stackoverflow.com is a great place to look for example code. Here we list some answers to basic R questions that I have posted to Stackoverflow.com over the past few years that illustrate essential R concepts to solve various problems. 

1. [What happens inside the curly braces?](https://bit.ly/2UK6o28)
2. [What is the meaning of $ in an R function?](https://bit.ly/2V1K7M5)
3. [What is the difference between the workspace and environments?](https://bit.ly/3e0ar1Y)
4. [How do I read .txt files from a subdirectory in R?](https://bit.ly/39F2viZ)
5. [How do I repeatedly shuffle a deck of cards in R?](https://bit.ly/3aMNn4z)
